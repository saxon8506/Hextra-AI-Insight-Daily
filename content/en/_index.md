    Microsoft's aggressive integration of Copilot into Windows 11 has hit a wall, facing public backlash and prompting a full reassessment [Source (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46854951). Critics are pointing fingers at the "AI everywhere" strategy, saying it went off the rails. Who thought jamming a Copilot button into Notepad was a good idea? 🤷‍♀️ Forced OneDrive integration and prioritizing web searches in the Start menu also got users seriously riled up. While this pullback might look like a quick PR fix, some doubt it's more than just a surface-level tweak, arguing that the underlying governance incentives haven't been touched.

2.  **Grok Launches Imagine 1.0 Video Generation.**
    Grok just dropped a cool new feature: Imagine 1.0, a 10-second video generation tool [View Details (AI News)](https://x.com/Gorden_Sun/status/2018201267798188158).
