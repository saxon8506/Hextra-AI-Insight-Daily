*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy lays out our policies and procedures on how we collect, use, and spill the beans about your info when you're using our service. Plus, it fills you in on your privacy rights and how the law's got your back.

Your personal data? We use it to get our service up and running smoothly, and to make it even better. By hopping on board and using our service, you're giving us the thumbs-up to collect and use your info just as this Privacy Policy describes.

## Interpretations and Definitions

### Interpretations
Hey, just a heads-up! Words kicking off with a capital letter? They've got specific meanings, which you'll find defined below. Doesn't matter if they're singular or plural, those definitions hold true across the board.

### Definitions
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy:

- **Account**? That's your unique digital pad created for you to hop into our Service or certain parts of it.

- An **Affiliate** is basically a company that's either controlling another, being controlled by another, or chilling under common control with another. When we say "control," we're talking about having 50% or more of the voting power (shares, equity, you get the drill) to elect directors or call the shots.

- The **Company** (that's "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this doc, btw) is none other than **hubtoday**.

- Alright, **Cookies**! These are just tiny files a website pops onto your computer, phone, or whatever device you're using. They're packed with deets like your browsing history on that site, among other things.

- The **Country**? That's California, USA, folks!

- A **Device** is simply anything you use to tap into our Service, like your computer, mobile phone, or even a digital tablet.

- **Personal Data** is pretty straightforward: it's any info linked to someone who's already identified or can be identified.

- The **Service**? That's just our Website, plain and simple.

- A **Service Provider** is anyone, a person or a company, who crunches data for the Company. Think of them as the third-party pros we hire to help us run the Service, offer it for us, handle Service-related tasks, or give us a hand analyzing how people are using it.

- **Usage Data** is that info we snag automatically, either from you just using the Service or from the Service's own backend. For instance, how long you hung out on a particular page.

- The **Website**? That's **hubtoday**, which you can find chilling over at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- And **You**? That's either you, the individual rocking our Service, or the company or legal entity you're representing while using it. You got it!

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
When you're using our Service, we might just hit you up for some personal info that helps us connect with you or, you know, identify who you are. This personal stuff could be, but isn't limited to:

- Email address
- Usage data

#### Usage Data
Usage data? Yeah, that stuff automatically gets collected when you're just chilling and using our Service.

What's in that Usage data? It could be your device's IP address, browser type and version, which pages you visited on our Service, the exact time and date of your visit, how much time you spent there, unique device IDs, and other techie diagnostic data.

Accessing our Service with a mobile device? Cool! We might automatically snag some info like the type of mobile device you're rocking, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile OS, the kind of mobile browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. Just so you know!

Whenever you hit up our Service, either from your computer or phone, we might also scoop up the info your browser sends our way.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies

We totally use Cookies and similar tracking tech to watch what's happening on our Service and store some bits of info. The tracking gadgets we deploy — think beacons, tags, and scripts — are all about collecting and tracking data, and ultimately, making our Service better and understanding how it's used. Here's a peek at what we might use:

- First up, **Cookies (or Browser Cookies)**: It's just a tiny file that gets plonked onto your device. You can totally tell your browser to say "nope" to all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's coming your way. But heads-up, if you don't play nice with Cookies, some parts of our Service might not work for you. Unless you've already tweaked your browser settings to reject them, our Service might just go ahead and use Cookies.
- Next, **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might have these tiny electronic files, also known as clear GIFs, pixel tags, or single-pixel GIFs. These little guys let the Company, say, count how many users have checked out certain pages or opened an email. They also help with other website stats, like seeing how popular a section is or making sure our systems and servers are all good.

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies, you know? Persistent ones chill on your computer or phone even after you're offline, but Session Cookies? They bounce the second you close your browser.

We're using both Session and Persistent Cookies, and here's why:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies** 👇
  *   **Type**: Session Cookies
  *   **Managed by**: Yours truly
  *   **Purpose**: These Cookies are super vital for making sure you get all the services available on our Website and can use its awesome features. They're like the bouncers that verify users and keep fraudsters from messing with accounts. Seriously, without these, the services you're asking for just wouldn't work, and we *only* use them to give you those essential services.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies** 👇
  *   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  *   **Managed by**: Us
  *   **Purpose**: These Cookies just keep tabs on whether you've already given your nod to using cookies on our Website. Simple as that!

- **Functionality Cookies** ✨
  *   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  *   **Managed by**: Us
  *   **Purpose**: These bad boys help us remember your choices when you're cruising around the Website – stuff like your login info or language preference. The big idea here is to give you a super personalized experience, so you don't have to keep punching in your preferences every time you stop by.

Wanna know more about the Cookies we use and what your choices are? Just hop over to our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section in this very Privacy Policy.

### How We Use Your Personal Data

The Company might just use your Personal Data for these reasons:

- First off, **to provide and keep our Service running smoothly**, which includes keeping an eye on how it's being used.
- Next, **to manage your Account**: We're talking about handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you hand over lets you unlock all the cool features available to you as a registered user.
- And **for busting out a contract**: This means setting up, sticking to, and delivering on the purchase contract for any products, items, or services you've bought, or any other agreement you've made with us through the Service.
- We also use it **to get in touch with you**: This could be via email, phone calls, SMS, or other electronic messages (think push notifications from our mobile app). We'll hit you up with updates or info about features, products, or services you've signed up for, including security updates, whenever it's necessary or just makes sense.
- We'll also **hook you up with news**, special offers, and general info about other cool stuff, services, and events we're offering. These will be similar to what you've already bought or checked out, unless, of course, you've told us to chill and not send you that kind of info.
- And **to manage your requests**: Yep, that's all about handling and sorting out any requests you send our way.
- Also, **for business transfers**: We might use your info if we're looking to evaluate or pull off a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or some other sale or transfer of our assets – whether we're still running or going through bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar processes. In those cases, the Personal Data we hold about our Service users could be one of the assets getting transferred.
- Finally, **for other purposes**: We might use your info for things like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promo campaigns are hitting the mark, and generally sizing up and boosting our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience.

So, when might we share your personal info? Here are the scenarios:

- First, **with Service Providers**: We might hand over your personal info to Service Providers who help us monitor and analyze how our Service is being used, and also to get in touch with you.
- Next, **for business transfers**: Your personal info might get shared or transferred during any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or when another company acquires all or part of our business – either during negotiations or the actual transfer.
- Also, **with Affiliates**: We might share your info with our Affiliates. If we do, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too. Affiliates include our main parent company, any other subsidiaries, joint venture pals, or other companies we control or share control with.
- And **with business partners**: We might team up with our business partners and share your info so they can offer you some cool products, services, or promos.
- Finally, **with other users**: If you're sharing personal info or interacting in the public areas with other users, just know that info could be seen by everyone and even broadcast externally.
- Oh, and **with your consent**: We might totally spill your personal info for any other reason, as long as you give us the green light!

### Retention of Your Personal Data

The Company's only going to hang onto your personal data for as long as we need it for the purposes we've laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll keep and use your personal data as much as required to meet our legal duties (like if the law says we gotta hold onto it), iron out any disagreements, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are followed.

The Company also keeps Usage Data for its internal analysis. Typically, Usage Data doesn't stick around too long, unless we're using it to crank up our Service's security, pump up its features, or if a legal obligation makes us keep it for a longer haul.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data

Your info (yep, that includes Personal Data) gets processed right here at the Company's main offices and wherever else the folks handling that data are located. This means your info might get shipped off to, and stored on, computers outside your state, province, country, or even governmental jurisdiction. Just a heads-up: those places might have data protection laws that are different from yours.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and sending us your info, you're essentially giving us the nod for that transfer.

The Company is totally committed to taking all the reasonable steps needed to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We're not going to ship your Personal Data off to any organization or country unless we've got rock-solid controls in place, including top-notch security for your data and other personal info.

### Deleting Your Personal Data

You've got the right to wipe out or ask us to give you a hand deleting any Personal Data we've gathered about you.

Our Service might actually let you zap some of your info directly from within the Service, how cool is that?

You can totally log into your Account (if you've got one, of course!) whenever you want, then cruise over to the account settings where you can manage your personal info. From there, you can update, tweak, or delete your deets. Or, hey, just hit us up directly to ask for access, corrections, or to delete any personal info you've shared with us.

Just a heads-up though: we might have to keep some info if we're legally required to or have a valid reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company ever gets tangled up in a merger, acquisition, or selling off assets, your Personal Data could totally get transferred. We'll make sure to give you a shout before your Personal Data moves over and falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
Sometimes, the Company might just have to spill your Personal Data if the law says so, or if a public authority (like a court or government agency) sends us a valid request.

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might just decide to dish out your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:

- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data

The security of your Personal Data? Super important to us! But let's be real, no method of zipping stuff over the internet or storing it electronically is ever 100% bulletproof. While we bust our chops using commercially acceptable methods to keep your Personal Data safe, we just can't promise it's absolutely impenetrable.

## Children's Privacy

Listen up: our Service isn't meant for anyone under 13. We're not intentionally collecting personal info from anyone that young. If you're a parent or guardian and you find out your kid has given us Personal Data, please, please reach out! If we discover we've snagged Personal Data from a munchkin under 13 without getting verifiable parental consent, we're totally going to scrub that info from our servers.

If we ever need to lean on consent as the legal reason to process your info, and your country actually requires parental consent, then you bet we'll ask for your parents' blessing before we collect and use that data.

## Links to Other Websites

Our Service might just have links that whisk you away to other websites we don't operate. If you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be zapped right over to their site. Seriously, we totally recommend peeking at the Privacy Policy of every single website you visit.

We've got zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. Just sayin'.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We might totally tweak our Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we'll give you a heads-up about any changes by simply slapping the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before those changes officially kick in, we'll make sure to tell you via email and/or a clear notice on our Service. Plus, we'll update that "Last updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy.

Seriously, we recommend you peek at this Privacy Policy regularly to catch any changes. Any tweaks to this Privacy Policy become official the moment they're posted right here on this page.
