# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "**the Site**" or "**we**")! 😉 Before diving into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. Your access or use of the Site means you're totally on board with these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
**The Site** offers users paid subscription content and membership services. This sweet package includes (but isn't limited to!) blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interaction. Heads up, though: some content is exclusively for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account. Easy peasy!
- **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities happening under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing your account** – that's a big no-no!
- **The Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms. Play by the rules, folks!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with costs clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden fees here!
- **All payments** are processed securely through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, **the Site** doesn't store any of your payment info. Your security is paramount!
- **Subscriptions** will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Don't forget if you want to stop!
- **Our 14-day refund policy** allows first-time subscribers to request a full refund within 14 days of purchase if they're not stoked with the service. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're dipping out. This awesome offer is limited to one refund per user. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscribers, payments are **non-refundable** unless legally required.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without permission. We put a lot of work into this!
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right of access** for personal learning and reading. Keep it personal, folks!
- **For commercial use or extensive quoting**, please reach out to the Site to get proper authorization. Let's chat!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **It is strictly forbidden** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes upon others' rights. Let's keep things positive and respectful!
- **It is also forbidden** to bulk download, scrape, or crack member-exclusive content using technical means. Seriously, play fair!
- **The Site** has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban users** who don't follow the rules. We're keeping our community safe and awesome.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads-up!
- **The Site** **does not accept liability** for compensation if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things are just out of our hands.

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information provided by the Site** is purely for reference and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical). Always consult an expert for specific needs!
- **The Site** **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses incurred by users from using the Site's content or services. Use your best judgment!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Keeping it legally clear!
- **Any disputes** arising from or related to these terms should first be resolved through friendly negotiation between both parties. If negotiations hit a snag, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's try to be friends first!
