# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "**the Site**" or "**we**"). Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to carefully read through these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially saying "I agree!" and accepting these terms. 👍

## 1. What We Offer
Our services are all about providing users with awesome paid subscription content and member perks! 🎁 This includes, but isn't limited to, blog articles, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Just a heads-up, some of that cool content is exclusively for our subscribed members. 🔒

## 2. Your Account & Registration
- To get your account set up, you'll need to provide a valid email address and pick a password. Easy peasy!
- Heads up: you're totally responsible for keeping your account secure and for anything that happens under your login. Seriously, **don't** transfer or share your account with anyone else! 🔐
- Just so you know, if you break these terms, we reserve the right to **pause or even close** your account. ⚠️

## 3. Your Paid Subscription Services
- Your subscription service is billed either monthly or annually, and you'll always see the exact cost clearly laid out on the checkout page. No surprises! 💸
- All payments go through awesome third-party platforms (think Stripe, PayPal, etc.). We **never** store your payment info on our end, so no worries there. 💳
- Just a heads-up: your subscription will **automatically renew**! Make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends if you don't want it to continue. 🗓️
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: If this is your very first time subscribing and you're not totally thrilled within 14 days of your purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the bottom of these terms) and let us know why you're bouncing. Each user gets this golden ticket only once! Beyond 14 days, or if you've subscribed before, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise. No returns after that, sorry! ↩️

## 4. Our Content & Your Rights (Intellectual Property stuff!)
- Quick heads-up: all the awesome original content you find here is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means you can't just copy it, repost it, or use it for commercial stuff without our say-so. 🚫
- What you *do* get is a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access it for your own personal learning and reading enjoyment. Keep it for yourself!
- If you're dreaming of using our content for commercial purposes or quoting a bunch of it, please get in touch with us first to snag authorization.

## 5. Your Behavior (Play Nice!)
- Seriously, **don't** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights. That's a big no-no! 🛑
- Also, **don't** try to mass download, scrape, or crack our member content using any tech tricks. We're watching!
- We reserve the right to yank any inappropriate content and even **ban users** who don't play by the rules. 🔨

## 6. Things Can Change (Service Updates & Outages)
- Just a heads-up: we reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services at any time, and we might not be able to give you a heads-up beforehand. 🔧
- Also, if something totally out of our control happens – like a natural disaster, server meltdown, or a third-party service hiccup – causing our content to be temporarily unavailable, we're **not on the hook for any compensation**. Stuff happens! ☁️

## 7. Our Disclaimer (FYI!)
- The info we dish out on the Site is purely for reference. Seriously, it **doesn't count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff), so please don't treat it as such. ⚖️
- And just so we're super clear, we're **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might experience from using our content or services. Use it wisely! ⚠️

## 8. Governing Law (The Serious Stuff)
- These Terms of Service are governed by, and interpreted according to, the laws of California, USA. We're keeping it simple and not diving into any tricky conflict of law principles. 📜
- If any squabbles pop up related to these terms, we'll try to sort them out nicely through friendly chats first. 🤝 But if we can't hug it out, you agree to take things to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. 👨‍⚖️
