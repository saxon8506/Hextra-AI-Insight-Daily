    Waymo, the autonomous driving giant, is set to integrate the Gemini [AI assistant (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/23993) right into its cars! 🚗💨 A leaked 1200-line instruction set shows it's designed to be a super chill companion. It can chat about the weather and tweak the AC, but absolutely, positively cannot interfere with driving operations. 🙅‍♀️ The assistant is programmed to speak in a super simple, "elementary schooler"-friendly style. 🗣️ This move really sets the bar for safety and ethical boundaries in the age of human-AI co-piloting. 🛣️

2.  **X platform, Elon Musk's baby, just rolled out a new AI image editing feature powered by Grok, leading to creator exodus.**
    X platform, Elon Musk's baby, just rolled out a new [AI image editing feature (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24012) powered by Grok! 🎨 Users can now click a button and *poof* ✨, casually tweak images in their posts. But guess what? This has seriously ticked off a ton of original artists and creators. 😡 Worried their work might get maliciously altered, many are opting to bail. 🏃‍♂️💨 This lack of a solid copyright protection mechanism has sparked some heated community debates. 🔥

### Frontier Research

1.  **Tsinghua, teaming up with Shengshu Technology, just open-sourced the lightning-fast TurboDiffusion, accelerating video generation by 200x.**
    Tsinghua, teaming up with Shengshu Technology, just open-sourced the lightning-fast [TurboDiffusion (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2025/12/365896.html)! 🚀 This bad boy can generate videos in less than 2 seconds on a *single* RTX 5090 GPU. Talk about a glow-up! It's a whopping 200 times faster than the original model. 🤯 The secret sauce? Its core SageAttention tech dramatically slashes computational load. 📉 And get this, the video dynamics and lighting quality suffer almost no loss. Pretty wild, right? ✨

2.  **Nanjing University's squad just dropped a mischievous new RunawayEvil jailbreak framework, specifically designed to mess with video models.**
    Nanjing University's squad just dropped a mischievous new [jailbreak framework (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MzI4MjgzMw==&mid=2651008926&idx=3&sn=62fd6830fa9878acb9029672ca09c19e) that's specifically designed to mess with video models! 😈 This system, aptly named RunawayEvil, boasts a success rate soaring to 87%. It rocks a "strategy-tactic-action" self-evolving attack paradigm. 💥 Mainstream video generation models? Their defenses are totally crumbling in its wake. 🛡️🤯 This is actually a super crucial testing tool for patching up those pesky AI security loopholes. 💡

3.  **The impact of quantization on Llama 3's causal reasoning ability is a hot topic.**
    So, what's the deal with Llama 3's causal reasoning ability [after quantization (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13725)? 🤔 Research spilled the tea, showing only a *slight* dip in interventional reasoning accuracy at NF4 precision. And get this, GraphRAG (Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation) can even *boost* inference accuracy! 💪 This provides some solid theoretical backup for deploying Llama 3 on edge devices. 💡

4.  **A new method is swooping in to eliminate the notorious approval bias that often plagues LLMs acting as judges.**
    A new method is swooping in to eliminate the notorious [approval bias (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11822) that often plagues LLMs acting as judges. 🧑‍⚖️ Seriously, these models tend to dish out glowing reviews and completely ignore invalid outputs. 🙈 But thanks to a regression model, this new approach has *drastically* slashed the misjudgment rate! 📉 In code feedback tasks, errors were cut by a whopping *half*. Pretty neat, huh? ✨

5.  **AI is now optimizing game strategies just like it writes code.**
    Get ready for AI to start optimizing [game strategies (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21024) just like it writes code! 🤖✍️ LLMs are acting as optimizers, constantly rewriting strategy code. This approach is crushing multi-agent collaboration challenges. 🤝 And in standard game theory scenarios, it's totally outperforming traditional methods. 🏆 Game on!

6.  **AI-generated image detection just got a fresh new approach with REM.**
    AI-generated image detection just got a fresh new approach with [REM (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20937)! 🛡️ Instead of obsessing over fake flaws, it's all about modeling the *boundaries* of real images. 👀 By generating near-authentic samples through self-reconstruction perturbations, it significantly boosts detection rates across different generators and degradation conditions. 🔍 Pretty clever, right?

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **The US H-1B visa rules just got a major shake-up, implementing high-salary weighting, potentially devastating international students.**
    The US H-1B visa rules just got a major shake-up 🔴, implementing [high-salary weighting (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652657511&idx=2&sn=fe18b45291ead0c5ca0d3d393d09a64e)! The random lottery is out, replaced by a salary-tier screening. 💸 This could mean doom for nine out of ten international students. 😬 Entry-level applicants are seeing their chances of getting picked *plummet*. 📉 Meanwhile, big tech players like Google are already restarting PERM to scoop up core talent. 🟢 What a wild ride!
