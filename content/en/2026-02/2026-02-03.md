### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **Microsoft Win11 AI generalization faces pullback.**
    Microsoft's Windows 11 has been causing a stir, big time! After literally *shoving* Copilot everywhere, the company hit some major public backlash and is now rethinking its approach ([Source (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46854951)). Critics are saying that management's 'AI Everywhere' strategy totally missed the mark, with things like Copilot buttons crammed into Notepad becoming a real sore point. Mandatory OneDrive integration and search-first in the Start Menu just made users absolutely furious 😠. While there's a short-term rollback, many are questioning if it's just a PR stunt and that the real governance issues haven't been tackled.

2.  **Grok launches Imagine 1.0 video generation.**
    Grok just dropped a bombshell 🚀 with its new Imagine 1.0, a 10-second video generation feature ([View Details (AI News)](https://x.com/Gorden_Sun/status/2018201267798188158))! The results are pretty solid, and it's super fast. The kicker? It's **completely free** ✨! This move directly challenges other paid video generation tools, showing some serious commitment.

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **Peking University & Stanford enable AI to autonomously discover Scaling Laws.**
    A research team from Peking University and Stanford just cooked up something wild: the 🚀 SLDAgent, enabling AI to discover scaling laws on its own ([Paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21184))! They built the SLDBench benchmark with over 5,000 real-world experiments. Get this: the formulas discovered by the AI actually **outperform human experts** in prediction accuracy 🤯! The work has already been accepted by ICLR 2026 and uses evolutionary algorithms to optimize both the formulas and the fitters simultaneously.

2.  **"Warm-up" training unlocks universal reasoning.**
    A new paper introduces a 🔥 two-stage training strategy to unlock universal reasoning ([arXiv (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13718)). First, models warm up with 'knights and knaves' logic puzzles, then proceed to RLVR with just a few target domain samples. Experiments show that this warm-up phase alone boosts performance on tasks like MATH and HumanEval+. The real kicker? It can achieve great results with **fewer than 100 samples**! ✨

3.  **VideoGPA makes video generation 3D more consistent.**
    VideoGPA, a new framework, uses geometric prior distillation to tackle the pesky **3D structural drift** issue in video diffusion models 💡 ([Paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23286)). It automatically generates preference signals via a geometric foundation model and then guides generation with DPO. The cool part? No manual annotation is needed, and it significantly boosts temporal stability and motion coherence.

4.  **AccidentSim generates realistic car crash videos.**
    AccidentSim is here, and it's generating shockingly realistic car crash videos 🚗! This research extracts physical information from actual accident reports to create collision videos ([arXiv (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20654)). It uses a physics simulator to recreate post-collision trajectories, then renders backgrounds with NeRF. The experiments prove these videos are seriously impressive in both visual and **physical realism**, providing crucial data for autonomous driving research.

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **Tsingcheng Zhizhi releases AI Ping evaluation platform.**
    The Tsinghua-backed team, Tsingcheng Zhizhi, just launched something pretty neat: AI Ping, a 'Yelp for large model APIs' 🔥 ([Details (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3MzI4MjgzMw==&mid=2651014886&idx=1&sn=096a9e29f196f9c11e1a2c794e613e9f))! This platform conducts 24/7 real-time tests on 555 model interfaces from 30 service providers, offering transparent comparisons. Their intelligent routing boosts TPS by a whopping **90%** and slashes costs by 37% 📈. Given that China's daily token consumption has skyrocketed 300-fold in 18 months, this tool couldn't have come at a better time.
